## FAQ

### Experience

You gain experience by fighting stronger opponents, but opponents no less than 25% weaker than you will still give you experience.

The strength of an opponent is calculated based on the following factors:

- max health
- armor amount and toughness
- resistance
- armor enhcants
- attack damage
- attack speed
- experience
- regeneration

The experience reward also depends on the strength of the target and the experience multiplier set in the config.

The experience is distributed via a MVP system to all the participants in the fight.

### Cursed Spirits

You will find shrines containing glass boxes with cursed objects inside randomly aorund the world.
The cursed objects attract cursed spirits depending on their grade. This means that a grade 4 cursed object would attract grade 4 cursed spirits while a special grade one would attract spirits of all grades.
Multiple cursed objects inside glass boxes placed near eachother will count as one and their grades will be combined.

Low level curses can also randomly spawn near villages while high level curses will spawn in nether fortresses.

Disaster cursed spirits (**Jogo**, **Dagon**, **Hanami**, **Mahito**) will spawn in their corresponding biomes.

**Jogo** will spawn at mountains, **Dagon** will spawn at beaches, **Hanami** will spawn at forests, and **Mahito** will spawn at villages.

### Traits

Traits are pretty self explanatory, they're unique traits of an sorcerer/cursed spirit.

**Six Eyes**, **Heavenly Restriction**, and **Vessel** can be obtained when you first join a world based on a random chance.
All of these chances can be adjusted in the config, you can also change whether traits are unique in a world or not.

**Six Eyes** reduces the cursed energy and points cost of abilities and cooldowns by 50%.

**Heavenly Restriction** gives you high physical stats and decreases cooldowns of melee/dash abilities.

**Vessel** allows you to eat Sukuna's fingers without getting posessed, being Sukuna's vessel also allows you to damage people that are using Idle Transfiguration's Soul Reinforcement.

### Natures

Cursed energy natures can be obtained when you first join a world based on a random chance. this chance can be adjusted in the config.

By default sorcerers will have the **Basic** cursed energy nature which will shield against damage and increase melee attack damage when **Cursed Energy Flow** is active.

Cursed energy natures **only work** when you're using **Cursed Energy Flow**

The **Rough** cursed energy nature works like Thorns V enchantment on armor.

The **Lightning** cursed energy nature gives you access to two abilities **Lightning** and **Discharge**.
**Lightning** fires a lightning bolt forwards and **Discharge** will deal a lot of damage to anything around you.

The **Divergent** cursed energy nature will make your punches have two impacts, the second impact being one with cursed energy.

### Types

When first joining a world you'll either be a sorcerer or a cursed spirit.

Sorcerers can awaken **Reverse Cursed Technique** while curses will be able to heal by default.

Curses can eat **cursed objects** to gain more cursed energy, this will also give them access to basic cursed energy manipulation such as **Cursed Energy Blast** and **Cursed Energy Bomb**.

Curses are vulnerable to sorcerers that are able to **output reverse cursed technique** and will take significant damage from it.

Curses by default will not take damage from attacks not imbued with cursed energy.

### Domains

When two domains occupy the same space a **domain clash** occurs, the domain's strength depends on the output and health of the caster.

When one domain is 75% stronger than the other, the weaker one will collapse allowing the sure-hit effect to take place.

When a domain interacts with a veil it will overpower it and take over the space. This mechanic can be used to get inside other's veils.

### Veils

Veils are created using a **Veil Rod** and an **Altar**, when placed in an altar you can add modifiers to the veil.

White squares mean that the modifier is allowed while black squares mean that it's denied.

Modifiers:

- Name Tag (represents a player with the name of the name tag)
- Dyes (can be used to change the color of the veil)
- Glass (can be used to make the veil transparent)
- Cursed Objects (cursed spirits)
- Cursed Tools (sorcerers)
- TNT (destruction)
